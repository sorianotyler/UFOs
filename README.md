Javascript and HTML program to create an interactive webpage to analyze UFO sighting data

## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is quickly filter data for multiple criteria on an interactive webpage.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to use javascript and HTML to build a webpage users can interact with the data, filtering for date, city, state, country, and even the shape of the UFO. This would allow for more in-depth analysis of UFO sights for users who are unfamiliar with working with databases.  

 
## Results 
You can perform an analysis by using the filter search boxes on the left-hand side of the page. Please refer to the screenshots in the images folder for reference. As you enter information in the text boxes, the page will change instantly. You can get rid of filters by simply clearing the text boxes or restarting the page. 
   
## Summary 
In conclusion, the webpage is interactive and quickly displays findings based on filters. One drawback of this page would be that it might perform slow on bigger datasets. I would improve this further by changing the format to make it more readable and fix the back-end code to make it run faster.
